- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KaylemFiji

- For ahwile I've always had the dream of becoming a huge geek in coding and machine learning. Over my experience, it takes more discipline than intelligence when it comes to 
being a great coder. Hence I begin my journey 12/02/22 to strive to be more disciplined and grow in knowledge and love for code. 
And i hope you do too...
